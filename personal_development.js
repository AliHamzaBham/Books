        "text": "Key idea 1 of 6\nContrary to what many think, overconfidence isn’t harmless.\n“Think you can or think you can’t – either way you’re right.” This quote, commonly attributed to Henry Ford, offers one way to think about confidence. It suggests that confidence is everything, and that your ability to succeed depends only on the amount of confidence you have.\nBut is this true? Well, yes and no. Make no mistake, belief in your own ability is important for success, and underconfidence can result in missed opportunities. But it’s not true that success comes down to simply believing in yourself. In fact, there are plenty of cases where overconfidence can be more harmful to your chances at success than underconfidence.\nThe key message in this blink is: Contrary to what many think, overconfidence isn’t harmless.\nOverconfidence is dangerous because of how people make decisions. Decision-making is hard. People rarely have enough information to make a truly educated decision, and so they depend on their intuition to make choices, even important ones. But intuition can – and often does – lead to mistakes.\nHistory is full of tragic accidents that came about because people made snap decisions that vastly overestimated their own ability. Take the 2008 financial crisis, for example: everyone was overconfident that they knew the value of the subprime mortgages they were buying. The fallout when people realized they didn’t? A global economic crisis.\nIn fact, research shows that too much confidence can sometimes lead to inferior performances. Psychologist Gabrielle Oettingen has studied the effect of confidence on outcomes and found that people who fantasize more about future successes are actually less likely to accomplish them. This effect can be seen on scales both large and small. A student who thinks he’s already prepared for a test might not study enough and doom himself to a bad grade. Or imagine two companies – one that anticipates great results in the next quarter and one that expects to be in the red. The second one will be more motivated to make changes for the better.\nThe lesson here is to use confidence to help you start the work you need to succeed, not bypass it. Confidence alone won’t let you finish a marathon if you’ve never run before. But confidence can give you the push to start training, one mile at a time.\nWant to see all full key ideas from Perfectly Confident?\nShow Create account\nor\nSign up with Facebook\nOur Terms of Service apply.

        "text": "Key idea 1 of 6\nWeirdness is a phenomenon that affects us all – whether or not we realize it.\nThe first thing you should know is that if you feel weird, you’re not alone. Whether you were bullied in school, or work in a field where most of your colleagues don’t look, sound, or act like you, feeling different is something almost everyone has experienced.\nAnd it’s a phenomenon that’s growing, in the US at least. According to the author’s research, 54 percent of Americans have had the feeling that no one knows them very well.\nBut even if you’ve never felt weird, there’s an increasing polarization of American society – and it reflects the fact that lots of us are very uncomfortable when we feel out of place. We don’t talk to our neighbors anymore, and we definitely don’t make friends with people who have different political views.\nThe key message here is: Weirdness is a phenomenon that affects us all – whether or not we realize it.\nMaybe you recognize that weirdness deserves your attention. But how do you pinpoint when, exactly, something is weird? Some things aren’t so clear-cut; like pornography, weirdness can be hard to define – you know it when you see it.\nThe author, Olga Khazan, is no stranger to feeling like an outsider. When she was a toddler, her parents moved the family from Russia to a small city in West Texas. People there recognized Olga and her family as “weird” right away. Curious Texans would join her father’s Russian language course just to ask questions about Russia. One weathered man came to a session to ask, “Are there horses in Russia?” – and, after learning that indeed there were, never returned.\nIn her research, Olga interviewed over three dozen people whom society has labeled nonconformists and weirdos. Each has suffered the consequences of life on the fringes, whether through being physically different, or simply pursuing a career outside the norm. One interviewee, Daniel, is a teacher working in early childhood education – where men make up just 2 percent of employees. Another, Julia, is a female NASCAR driver competing in a sport where a woman has never won a top race.\nBut Olga, Daniel, and Julia have all managed to transform their weirdness into their superpower. In these blinks, you’ll learn how they did it – and how you can mimic their success.\nWant to see all full key ideas from Weird?\nShow Create account\nor\nSign up with Facebook\nSign up with Google\nOur Terms of Service apply.

        "text": "Key idea 1 of 8\nNarrowing the focus of your visual attention helps you reach your goals more effectively.\nRunning a marathon is no easy feat. Winning one is something very few individuals achieve. In 1984, Joan Benoit Samuelson became the first-ever female Olympic marathon champion. What helped her win? It wasn't so much about having the right shoes or eating the right breakfast. She attributes her success to maintaining a narrow focus.\nWhen Samuelson runs, she doesn’t dwell on the 26.2 miles ahead of her. She instead scans the runners ahead of her, picks one, then passes. And once she leaves that runner behind, she picks another runner to pass, and so on. By setting small, manageable goals, the Olympic gold became hers.\nThe key message here is: Narrowing the focus of your visual attention helps you reach your goals more effectively.\nThe first key visualization strategy, adopting a narrow focus, can help you improve the quality of not only physical exercise, but any long-term goal you set for yourself.\nIn one experiment, the author and her research team studied gym goers’ perceptions about exercise, and found that how they looked at their surroundings produced significant results.\nThe team added weighted cuffs to the gym goers’ ankles, which increased their body weight by 15 percent, and asked them to walk as quickly as possible to a finish line. One group was told to keep their eyes on the finish line and to avoid looking around. A second group was told to look around as they would normally. The group that focused solely on the finish line estimated that it was 30 percent closer than the other group. They also used 17 percent less effort in walking to the finish line and got there 23 percent quicker.\nThe benefits of a narrow focus translate into other aspects of life, such as financial planning. Take, for example, retirement savings. An experiment conducted by social psychologist Hal Hershfield suggests that visualizing your life as a retiree motivates you to start saving money for retirement at an earlier age. He found a way to introduce young people to their future selves. How? He took photos of people in his community and edited them into aged versions of themselves. Those faced with a visualization of themselves in 45 years’ time planned to set aside 6.2 percent of their current salary for retirement. In contrast, those who saw photos of their current selves set aside only 4.4 percent.\nKeeping your eyes on the prize is integral to achieving your goals – but this is just one visualization strategy that successful people implement.\nWant to see all full key ideas from Clearer, Closer, Better?\nShow Create account\nor\nSign up with Facebook\nSign up with Google\nOur Terms of Service apply.

        "text": "Key idea 1 of 8\nChanging your attitude towards uncertainty opens you up to discovery.\nThe engineers and scientists at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory have a strange tradition. At crucial moments in every space mission, they chomp on peanuts. This phenomenon began when a Ranger spacecraft successfully launched after a long run of failures. An engineer had brought a bag of peanuts into mission control that day. Since then, peanuts are eaten at every launch to ward off bad luck.\nThis shows that even the most scientific among us fear uncertainty. That’s why we engage in strange rituals – like eating peanuts or wearing our lucky jeans – to regain a sense of control. We can’t help feeling this way. Fear of the unknown helped keep our ancestors safe from saber-toothed tigers. But when we avoid uncertainty altogether, we close ourselves off to new possibilities.\nThe key message here is: Changing your attitude towards uncertainty opens you up to discovery.\nScientists don’t see uncertainty as something to fear. When faced with a dark, shadow-filled room, they don’t turn away like most of us. They poke around in it until they find a light switch. Once that light’s on, they can evaluate what they’ve found. There might be something curious in the room, or there may be another door leading to yet another mystery.\nUncertainty doesn’t make scientists panic. It invigorates them. Instead of worrying about the monsters that might be lurking in corners, they focus on all the amazing things awaiting discovery.\nThere are some practical steps you can take to get excited about the unknown, instead of letting it inhibit you. Start by asking yourself what the worst possible outcome would be. Next, consider how likely it is for that outcome to occur. Writing down these thoughts puts them in perspective, since tragedy rarely strikes. More often than not, you’ll see that the things you value most will still be intact, even if the worst scenario plays out. Acknowledging this disarms your fears about venturing down a new path. Once you’ve faced your fears, you’ll be free to set off on your journey and see what you can achieve.\nWant to see all full key ideas from Think Like a Rocket Scientist?\nShow Create account\nor\nSign up with Facebook\nSign up with Google\nOur Terms of Service apply.

        "text": "Key idea 1 of 8\nNo Limit Texas Hold’em mirrors our probabilistic universe.\nIn No Limit Texas Hold’em, each player is dealt two cards facedown. There are also community cards, which are dealt faceup in the center of the table. The three community cards dealt after the first round of betting are known as “the flop.” Over the course of the game, two additional community cards are added to the table.\nIn a tournament, poker chips represent a player’s financial stake in the game. The goal is to win as many chips as possible.\nGoing clockwise around the table, each player has to decide whether to play or fold, which means you discard your hand. If you decide to play your cards, you have the option to call, or match the prior bet’s amount. Or you can raise, which means upping the amount of the prior bet. Over the four rounds of betting, you can try to estimate how your cards stack up against other players’ cards based on their behavior. At the end, the player who holds the best hand of cards – or who hasn’t folded – wins the game.\nNo Limit Texas Hold’em is the most popular variant of poker. But Maria chose to pursue this particular game because of its parallels to daily life.\nThe key message here is: No Limit Texas Hold’em mirrors our probabilistic universe.\nOne of the features that differentiates No Limit Texas Hold’em from other kinds of poker is its balance between known and unknown factors. Between your two cards and the community cards, you have enough information so that the game isn’t entirely unpredictable.\nAt the same time, there’s nothing definite about the game – even if you learn the mathematical probabilities of certain hands. The resulting ratio between known and unknown factors makes it a game balanced between skill and chance. As the twentieth-century mathematician John von Neumann argued, poker mirrors the probabilistic universe that governs our daily lives.\nAnother distinguishing feature of No Limit Texas Hold’em is that there’s no limit to the amount you can bet. At any round of the game, you can place an all-in bet, meaning you place all of your chips in the pot. Life is a similarly high-risk, high-reward endeavor. Nothing stops us from investing all of our money, heart, or even life itself into investments with no guarantees.\nIf you’re confused about the rules of poker, don’t worry. It’s a complex game. Even Maria needed months of rigorous study to understand it fully. Luckily, you don’t need to be a master poker player to apply its wisdom to your own rulebook.\nWant to see all full key ideas from The Biggest Bluff?\nShow Create account\nor\nSign up with Facebook\nSign up with Google\nOur Terms of Service apply.

        "text": "Key idea 1 of 10\nThere are several kinds of serendipity, but they’re all different than “blind” luck of the draw – they’re about creating “smart luck.”\nWhat is serendipity, exactly? The word itself dates back to 1754 when British writer Horace Walpole used it to describe a kind of discovery that was made unexpectedly, by accident, or through a certain foresighted wisdom known as sagacity.\nThis definition has more or less stood the test of time. For our purposes, we’ll think of serendipity as a positive occurrence, one made when your actions collide with chance. This means serendipity is different from pure chance, or luck on its own.\nThe key message here is: There are several kinds of serendipity, but they’re all different than “blind” luck of the draw – they’re about creating “smart luck.”\nGenerally speaking, there are three types of serendipity:\nThe first is Archimedes Serendipity. This is when you’re looking for a solution to a specific problem and the solution arrives in an unexpected way. The name comes from the story of how Archimedes solved the problem of King Hiero’s crown. King Hiero had hired a goldsmith to make a crown – and he’d given him a precise amount of gold to make it from. The goldsmith forged the crown, and it weighed exactly as much as the gold he’d been given, but King Hiero grew suspicious. What if it was a forgery?\nSo Hiero called upon the brilliant Archimedes to test its authenticity.\nArchimedes thought it over. And during his brainstorming, he went to the public baths. Here, serendipity struck. Archimedes noticed how the water levels rose as people lowered themselves into the baths – and, in a flash, he knew how to test the crown.\nGold is denser than silver. This means that, if a pure-silver crown and a pure-gold crown weighed the same amount, the pure-silver crown would be larger. And a larger crown would displace more water than a smaller crown. Thus, Archimedes correctly reasoned, if Hiero’s crown had been diluted with silver, it would displace more water than if it were pure gold. It was as easy as that!\nThe second type of serendipity is Post-It Note Serendipity. This is when a solution is unexpectedly found for a problem that wasn’t even being considered at the time. The name comes from the Post-It note. They were invented when Dr. Spencer Silver, a researcher for 3M, was trying to develop a new type of strong glue. One attempt fell short. It wasn’t very sticky at all. But Silver was curious to discover the potential for this weak glue. It eventually became the perfect ingredient for the Post-It Note.\nFinally, there’s Thunderbolt Serendipity. As the name suggests, this is when you’re struck by a solution out of nowhere. You weren’t examining any specific problem or researching any particular solution. You were just going about your day when out of the blue an idea and exciting new opportunity presented itself.\nSometimes, serendipity might be a combination or variation of these types. But no matter what, these aren’t cases of blind luck. As we’ll see, hitting upon serendipity is something you can facilitate, as long as you have the right mindset.\nWant to see all full key ideas from The Serendipity Mindset?\nShow Create account\nor\nSign up with Facebook\nSign up with Google\nOur Terms of Service apply.

Helping others and collaborating with them greatly amplifies it.\n“Top of the class,” “first place,” and “best.” At school, on the sports field, and throughout our working careers, we’re taught to aim for top-ranked positions. It’s not enough to be good – we have to be better than everyone else. But what this implies is that there’s only so much success to go around. As a result, we become competitive and focused on accomplishing things on our own.\nBut approaching success this way actually puts a cap on what we can achieve. It may seem counterintuitive, but if we want to maximize our potential, we shouldn’t compete with those around us. Instead, we should help them succeed.\nThe key message here is: Perceiving success as a zero-sum game limits our potential. Helping others and collaborating with them greatly amplifies it.\nBy competing and relying on our individual skills, strengths, and other resources, we can only acquire limited success. Or, in the author’s words, we’re stuck in the realm of Small Potential. But when we help others succeed, our pool of available resources expands. And tapping into this wider pool makes it possible to accomplish much more than what we’re capable of alone.\nThis is Big Potential, and a study into the mating behavior of fireflies provides a glowing example of just how powerful it is. Research published in the journal Science revealed that when individual male fireflies light up randomly, there’s a 3 percent chance that a female will respond. But when large groups of male fireflies light up together, that number shoots up to 82 percent!\nLike these fireflies, when we collaborate, everyone benefits. And that’s not all.\nAchieving Big Potential isn’t just a one-off. The more we help others succeed, the more resources they gain in the form of experiences, skills, and opportunities. We have access to these resources and can use them to become better and gain bigger success ourselves. This creates a positive feedback loop called a Virtuous Cycle, in which Big Potential compounds and becomes easier and easier to achieve.\nSo, how do we go about establishing a Virtuous Cycle?\nThe answer is by planting SEEDS. But there’s no need for gardening tools; SEEDS is an acronym for the five steps to creating a Virtuous Cycle. We need to SURROUND, EXPAND, ENHANCE, DEFEND, and, finally, SUSTAIN. And in the following blinks, we’ll learn exactly what each of these steps involves.\nWant more?\nRead or listen to the key ideas\nfrom 7,000+ titles\nShow Create account\nor\nSign up with Facebook\nSign up with Google\nOur Terms of Service apply.

        "text": "Key idea 1 of 10\nTechnology makes our lives easier, but it may be hindering our learning abilities.\nIs digital technology good or bad? The question may be simple, but the answer is far from straightforward.\nOn the one hand, smartphones and tablets can seem liberating. After all, they do allow us to “outsource” some of our brain’s simpler functions. Sounds great, doesn’t it?\nWell, perhaps not. Some researchers feel that this digital habit is becoming a problem. They believe it hampers our cognitive abilities. Think about how we all constantly switch between tasks – from working to checking notifications to texting. One neuroscientist, Daniel J. Levitin, believes that this process causes the brain to quickly burn up its fuel, leaving us stressed and exhausted.\nThe key message here is: Technology makes our lives easier, but it may be hindering our learning abilities.\nWe have constant access to a wealth of information right at our fingertips. It’s no surprise then that studies indicate that the average person consumes three times more information today than in the 1960s!\nBut pummeling ourselves with all this information isn’t necessarily a good thing. That’s because being able to look up facts whenever you need them causes your memory to atrophy. It withers away, like an under-used muscle. On the other hand, forcing yourself to recall information actually creates and strengthens memories.\nOverusing technology may also reduce your capacity to think critically. After all, there’s no shortage of opinion on the internet. Some would say that it’s a good thing: it allows us to see issues from lots of different perspectives.\nBut the truth is that most of us don’t actually go looking for varied perspectives. Instead, we identify a few sources we already agree with, and use them to reinforce our beliefs, thus essentially accepting other people’s ready-made opinions. This means that our capacity for deduction and problem-solving begins to weaken, and we lose the ability to think critically.\nSo it’s more important than ever to keep your brain in tip-top shape. How do you do this? Jim Kwik offers a few suggestions. One simple tip, especially pertinent for the digital age, is to spend 30 minutes each day with all your devices turned off. You can use this time to relax, be creative, and just let your mind wander.\nBut what if you do spend too much time with your devices? Will it change you – and your brain – forever? Well, maybe not. Our brains are resilient and adaptable, as we’ll see in the next blink.\nWant to see all full key ideas from Limitless?\nShow Create account\nor\nSign up with Facebook\nSign up with Google\nOur Terms of Service apply.

        "text": "Key idea 1 of 4\nMentorship is a pathway to professional growth\nMentorship is a powerful, collaborative relationship that fosters personal and professional growth. It involves a mentor – an experienced individual, who shares their knowledge and guidance with a mentee, someone seeking to learn and advance their career. The mentor's role is to provide support, challenge the mentee, offer feedback, and facilitate self-reflection, all while allowing the mentee to remain true to their core identity.\nThe benefits of mentorship are well-documented. Studies show that 25% of mentored employees experience salary uplifts, compared to only 5% of those without mentors. Mentees are also five times more likely to receive promotions. And 89% of mentees go on to become mentors themselves, perpetuating a cycle of knowledge-sharing and empowerment.\nMentorship is not merely a transactional exchange; it's a transformative experience that builds confidence and creates lasting connections. In one study, 97% of mentors and mentees expressed positive feedback about their mentoring relationships, and 87% of mentees reported increased self-assurance.\nAt its core, mentorship is a safe space for vulnerability, built on a foundation of empathy. It's a tool for developing skills, gaining industry insights, and broadening professional networks. It's a continuous learning process, where both mentor and mentee learn from each other.\nBut mentorship is not a quick fix or one-size-fits-all solution. It requires dedication and a tailored approach, as different mentors and mentees will have varying needs and goals. Mentorship is not a substitute for individual responsibility; the mentee remains accountable for their decisions and actions. It's also not a guaranteed ticket to overnight success but rather a journey that demands perseverance over time.\nNow, mentorship can take various forms, each with its own unique dynamics.\nFirst we have peer-to-peer mentorship. This is a collaborative relationship between individuals at similar career stages. This contrasts with traditional mentorship, which is where a senior, experienced mentor guides a junior employee. We can also have reverse mentorship, where an early-career individual mentors a more experienced person, often to share insights into emerging technologies or trends. And finally there’s group mentorship, where multiple individuals support each other in achieving common goals, such as a professional working group for women in the workplace.\nEffective mentors understand their roles and responsibilities. They provide guidance, challenge their mentees, offer feedback, encourage self-reflection, set goals, and create actionable plans. Mentors don't merely impart knowledge; they empower mentees to discover their own potential.\nThroughout your career journey, it helps to cultivate a diverse network of mentors, each serving a unique purpose. There are five different types of mentor.\nThe first type is the Company Insider. This mentor understands the inner workings of your organization, navigates office politics, and shares insights into organizational structures and processes.\nThe second type of mentor is the Skill Master. This mentor has expertise in a specific skill, such as public speaking or project management, and can help you develop that skill.\nThe Money-Minded mentor is our third type of mentor. This mentor assists with salary negotiations and strategies for promotion. Fourth is the Industry Mentor, who, with deep knowledge of your industry, provides valuable insights into trends, challenges, and opportunities.\nAnd fifth and finally we have the Network Mentor, who helps you expand and nurture your professional connections.\nNow, it’s up to you to figure out which type of mentor you’ll need at different stages of your career. And once you’ve found the right person, you’ll need to get them on board.

        "text": "Key idea 1 of 6\nA Frenchman in Algiers.\nThe Stranger has one of the most recognizable openings in twentieth century literature. It begins with the words: “Maman died today. Or maybe yesterday, I don’t know.”\nThis is not only an attention-grabbing start; it also says a lot about our narrator and central character, Meursault. Meursault is a Frenchman living in Algiers. From the start, his reaction to his mother’s death is marked by one thing in particular, indifference, which is a main theme of the book.\nTo put it another way, Meursault receives the news of his mother's death with a detached acceptance. A while ago, Meursault had his mother put in a nursing home. Now, uncertain of the exact day she passed, he arranges to attend the funeral more out of obligation than grief.\nOnce he arrives at the nursing home, the director informs Meursault of his mother's wish for a religious burial, a detail that surprises him since his mother had never shown any interest in religion. When offered the chance to see her body one last time, Meursault declines. He does, however, agree to a cup of coffee and shares a cigarette with the caretaker.\nAs night falls, Maman's friends arrive and hold a silent vigil. The following morning, the director allows Thomas Pérez, one of Maman's close friends, to join the funeral procession, mentioning that she considered him her “fiancé.”\nAll along the trip to the nursing home, as well as during the procession to the cemetery, Meursault appears to be most affected by immediate concerns. In particular, he seems defeated by the hot summer weather and his exhaustion from traveling.\nThe next day, Meursault returns to Algiers. At the beach, he encounters Marie, a former colleague with whom he shares a brief romantic history. He asks Marie to go to a movie later that evening. She agrees, and they go to see a comedy. Afterward, Marie and Meursault spend the night together.\nSpending Sunday in his apartment, Meursault settles into an old routine of mundane activities. He finds solace in small rituals, like cutting out newspaper ads and observing life from his balcony. He doesn’t really like Sundays; they are monotonous, boring. When he realizes that Monday will start the week all over again, he realizes that his mother's death hasn’t really changed anything.\nWant to see all full key ideas from The Stranger?\nShow Create account\nor\nSign up with Facebook\nSign up with Google\nOur Terms of Service apply.

        "text": "Key idea 1 of 5\nShaping your expectations with effective pre-reading strategies.\nHave you ever pondered the significance of the two most important days in your life, as Mark Twain famously did – the day you were born and the day you discovered why?\nJust as finding your purpose in life can transform your existence, approaching reading with a specific goal activates your brain’s goal-seeking mechanism, sharpening focus and enhancing comprehension. Whether your aim is mastering a new skill, acing an exam, or diving into the depths of a good novel, identifying this purpose gears up different regions of your brain to work in concert. Suddenly, like noticing a specific car everywhere after you’ve decided to buy it, your brain zeroes in on relevant information, filtering out the noise to spotlight what’s important to you.\nLet’s start by trying this exercise: note down everything you’ve read recently and pinpoint the reasons for each choice. This will aid you in organizing your future reading and prime your brain, aligning your cognitive resources with your interests and goals, and making your reading both efficient and impactful.\nNow let’s consider the practice of previewing material before you dive in deep. This is a little like exploring a new city before settling down – a strategy that unveils the layout and primes your expectations. A preview acts as a scaffold, a preliminary sketch that guides your understanding and aids in assembling the puzzle pieces of new knowledge. As you glance through the titles, subtitles, and highlighted texts in a book, you’re not just skimming; you’re constructing a mental framework for the detailed exploration that lies ahead.\nFor practice, try previewing some diverse reading materials you’ve gathered. By examining titles, introductions, and summaries without delving into the full text, you train your brain to anticipate and structure the information, making the actual reading smoother and more intuitive.\nBut remember that not all reading requires the same approach. Different materials demand different speeds and levels of engagement. A novel may invite a leisurely pace, allowing for immersion in its world, while a technical manual requires slow, deliberate attention to grasp complex information. Adjusting your reading style based on the material’s nature and your objectives optimizes both your enjoyment and the efficiency of learning.\nTry experimenting with altering your reading pace and focus across various texts. This should make you proficient in shifting gears, ensuring you can navigate through dense academic texts with the same ease as through light magazine articles, enriching your reading experience with flexibility and depth.\nWhen you incorporate these practices into your reading routine it’ll be transformed from a passive activity into an active journey of discovery. By setting a purpose, previewing your path, and adapting your reading style, you unlock a more fulfilling and effective way to engage with the written word, making every reading session a step toward achieving your personal and professional goals.\nWant to see all full key ideas from Speed Reading?\nShow Create account\nor\nSign up with Facebook\nSign up with Google\nOur Terms of Service apply.

        "text": "Key idea 1 of 3\nGrowth begins with planting seeds\nImagine walking through a forest of oak trees. The trees tower above you, creating dappled shadows on the earth below.\nHow can you build something in your life as potent and as valuable as an oak forest? You start by planting acorns. How do you do that? You collect fallen acorns from mature oaks. Then you drop them in water; the ones that sink are healthy, while those that float are rotten. Then you plant the healthy acorns, water them, and tend to them. Most won't sprout, but the few that do take root will, with care and patience, grow into mighty trees that can stand for generations.\nOak trees are the perfect metaphor for remarkable achievements in life. You must gather seeds of potential, plant them hopefully, nurture them tirelessly, and wait patiently to see which ideas take hold and flourish. You can’t predict which ones will thrive. But you must trust the process, follow your heart, and tend faithfully to all that you have sown.\nThis approach stands in contrast to some advice we often get: “Find your passion”. Passions are often overrated, especially early in life. There is too much pressure to find one’s true calling at a young age. A better approach is to pursue many different interests without overthinking it. Cast a wide net, try new things, and see what grabs you. True passions emerge gradually from a succession of curiosities that captivate you. They start as humble acorns of interest that you nurture over years until they grow into towering oaks.\nAdopting a growth mindset is the key to unlocking your full potential and living a remarkable life. This mindset is defined by the conviction that your qualities and abilities can be developed through effort, effective strategies, and support from others. On the other hand, those with a fixed mindset believe that their qualities are unchangeable and set in stone.\nOne powerful way to plant seeds of potential is through education, both in and out of the classroom. For Stephen Wolfram, a precocious physicist who won a MacArthur “genius grant” at a young age, the key was learning to find knowledge on his own. As a child, he sought out books of physics and mathematics. He was amazed to discover that libraries existed – places where you dive into knowledge of virtually any subject. For Wolfram, reading widely and voraciously was its own form of education, opening up new vistas of understanding, which he would later incorporate into his scientific work.\nAnother way to plant seeds is via other people – by putting yourself out there and meeting strangers from all walks of life. The author has benefited from many such chance encounters. While getting his son’s iPhone fixed at an Apple Store, a random encounter led to a meeting with Shaun Tomson, a world-champion surfer from the 1980s. On another occasion, while the author was himself surfing in Santa Cruz, a new friend introduced him to two remarkable people: Leon Panetta, the former US Secretary of Defense, and Dave Ebert, a renowned shark expert, author, and TV personality. Each conversation with a stranger holds the potential to expand life in unforeseen ways, so stay open and curious. The wider your network, the better opportunities can find you. Build bridges by smiling, listening intently, and focusing on the positive. You never know where a casual chat might lead.\nAs you gather seeds of potential, stay humble and strive to learn from every experience, even unglamorous ones. When musician and entrepreneur Derek Sivers was 17 years old, his first paying gig was strolling around a pig show strumming his guitar for a measly $75. He jumped at the random offer, gave it his all, and impressed the folks who hired him. That humble pig show led to an invitation to play at a fancy art gallery opening, which in turn launched a lucrative career performing over 1,000 circus shows. Saying “yes to everything,” as Sivers describes it, can be a useful approach, especially early in one’s career.\nDo the tasks no one else wants to do. Master skills that make you uniquely valuable. Be a team player who makes your colleagues shine. With the right mindset, there are no truly dead-end jobs – only opportunities to prove yourself and expand your capabilities.\nWant to see all full key ideas from Think Remarkable?\nShow Create account\nor\nSign up with Facebook\nSign up with Google\nOur Terms of Service apply.

        "text": "Key idea 1 of 4\nGoogle is your new resume\nWhat if everything you thought you knew about finding a great job was wrong? In today’s rapidly evolving world, the conventional path of crafting a perfect, polished resume and hoping to stand out from the stack of other qualified candidates is a losing proposition. Some of the most successful people have gotten where they are by doing the opposite – focusing on building a unique personal brand.\nTake Marian Schembari, a liberal arts graduate who dreamed of working in publishing but couldn’t land a single interview. Rather than sending out more resumes, she took $100 and bought Facebook ads targeting employees at the top NYC publishing houses. Her story went viral in the industry, and soon she was being urged to apply by insiders at every major publisher.\nAuthor Michael Ellsberg argues that your personal brand – what people think of when they hear your name – is significantly more important than your resume. A strong brand can open doors that no credential can. Too many people spend years building up their resume while neglecting to cultivate their brand and reputation.\nBuilding a brand means creating remarkable things and making sure there’s a Google trail leading to it all. Like Maria Andros, who went from being a corporate burnout to a successful entrepreneur while creating a devoted YouTube following documenting her journey. Or Robert Scoble, who made himself an influential tech blogger through his signature insider reports.\nThe secret, Ellsberg argues, is to radiate your unique personality rather than conforming to expectations. Danielle LaPorte didn’t let her lack of credentials stop her from landing a top literary agent and a book deal – based, seemingly, on sheer moxie. Her business advice, dished out with provocative flair, now commands $1,000 per hour.\nThe lesson is clear: what makes you stand out isn’t your degree or resume. Lots of people have that. The real key to professional success in the twenty-first century is to, first, create something original and, second, make sure the world knows about it. Conformity is out; cultivating a unique personal brand is in.\nAs Ellsberg puts it, while resumes get lost in the stack, your personal brand stays with you for life. How can you start creating yours? Google is the new resume, and it’s time to make sure yours stands out.\nWant to see all full key ideas from The Education of Millionaires?\nShow Create account\nor\nSign up with Facebook\nSign up with Google\nOur Terms of Service apply.

        "text": "Key idea 1 of 4\nNurturing brain development\nPicture this: your teenager comes home from school, throws their backpack on the floor, and slumps into the couch with a frustrated sigh. They mutter to themselves about how stupid they are and how they'll never understand math. As a parent, your heart sinks. You want to help, but you're not sure how.\nThis is where the neuroscience of mental strength comes in. You see, your child's brain is like a complex network of highways, constantly being shaped by their experiences. Every challenge they face, every success they celebrate, is literally molding the structure of their mind.\nThat’s because a brain is more like a garden than a machine: the neural connections are paths that either grow or wither based on whether or not they're being used. When your child practices a new skill or learns from a mistake, for instance, it's like pruning and nurturing those pathways, helping them grow stronger over time.\nThis concept is called neuroplasticity – the incredible ability of our brains to change and adapt throughout our lives. It means that no matter what challenges your child faces, their mind has the potential to grow and overcome them.\nBut here's the thing: as a parent, you have a tremendous influence over which paths get reinforced in your child's brain. Every time you encourage them to keep trying after a setback, you're strengthening their resilience. When you teach them to take a deep breath and talk through their feelings, you're helping them build emotional regulation skills. And when you create a safe, supportive environment at home, you're giving their brain the ideal conditions to thrive.\nIt's not always easy, of course. There are times when your child feels like giving up, or when they're convinced they're not good enough. But by understanding the neuroscience behind mental strength, you can be there to guide them through those moments.\nFor example, let's go back to that teenager frustrated with their math performance. Instead of simply telling them to try harder, you might reframe the challenge as an opportunity for growth. You could break down a problem together, for instance, and look for new approaches, all while reinforcing the idea that every time they tackle a problem they're actually growing new connections in their brain.\nBut it's not just about academics. The same principles apply to social challenges, emotional struggles, and any other obstacles your child may face. In the next chapter we’ll dive into how the brain’s development influences every aspect of a child’s behavior, especially in the developmental years from birth to their mid-20s.\nWant to see all full key ideas from Raising Mentally Strong Kids?\nShow Create account\nor\nSign up with Facebook\nSign up with Google\nOur Terms of Service apply.

        "text": "Key idea 1 of 4\nUnderstanding and reframing stress\nWhen she started a new job at a technology company, Laurie felt overwhelmed. The stress of working remotely, and constant worries about job security and performance weighed her down. Her annual review loomed large in her mind, exacerbating her stress to the point where it began to affect her physical health and social life. Laurie’s experience reflects a psychological theory – proposed by Richard Lazarus and Susan Folkman – which describes stress as a reaction to a perceived threat that surpasses your coping resources. It’s important to differentiate between stress, which typically arises from specific external pressures and is often short-term, and anxiety, which is a more generalized response that can persist even in the absence of external stressors.\nLaurie’s experience illustrates a common scenario: seeing stress as an insurmountable threat. But the first step to befriending stress is recognizing that it doesn’t have to be your enemy. Stress can be a motivator, a signal to engage with challenges in ways that promote growth and resilience. By reframing stressful situations as opportunities, you can transform your stress into action. This reframing involves actively choosing to see the potential benefits of stress, such as enhanced focus and heightened energy. For instance, Laurie set small, achievable goals like preparing one section of an important presentation each day, which channeled her anxious energy into productive tasks and utilized her body’s natural stress response to enhance performance, rather than hinder it. Research indicates that viewing stress as a potentially positive challenge can significantly alter physiological responses, reducing negative moods and improving cognitive function.\nBuilding on this idea of mental reorientation, let’s consider the story of Kai. A college student, Kai was known by his peers as someone with “no chill factor” – he simply couldn’t relax. He was always caught up in a web of repetitive thoughts that ranged from academic pressures to personal conflicts. Overthinking became his constant companion, stealing the joy from everyday moments and contributing to feelings of anxiety and exhaustion.\nKai’s story is a powerful reminder that breaking the cycle of overthinking is crucial. One effective strategy is mindfulness. This involves observing your thoughts and emotions without judgment and anchoring yourself in the present moment, such as noticing your breath or paying attention to the sensations in your body. This practice helps disrupt the flow of persistent negative thoughts, promoting a mental environment where proactive and positive thinking can flourish. Additionally, setting specific, actionable goals – like completing a set number of study pages each day – can focus your mental energy on constructive activities that align with your personal values and long-term objectives. Both mindfulness and goal setting are strategies supported by research for reducing anxiety and enhancing cognitive performance.\nLaurie’s and Kai’s stories highlight that understanding and reframing stress involves a dynamic interplay between perception and action. By viewing stress as a potentially positive challenge and actively engaging with your thoughts in healthier ways, you can foster a more empowering approach to the stresses of daily life. This shift alleviates your immediate stress and builds a foundation for sustained mental well-being and resilience.\nWant to see all full key ideas from Stress Resets?\nShow Create account\nor\nSign up with Facebook\nSign up with Google\nOur Terms of Service apply.

Some of the them had put their lives on the line to rescue the Jewish people who lived in the village. And some hadn’t. The sociologists wanted to see what differentiated the two groups.\nIt came down to parental discipline.\nThe individuals who had rescued Jewish people all had strong memories of their parents not only enforcing rules – such as “don’t cheat” – but also explaining why those rules were important. The rescuers understood the values that underpinned the rules.\nWant to inspire people to be the best version of themselves? Don’t focus on rules; identify values.\nThe key message: Identifying your core values increases your spiritual capacity.\nTo live your best life, you need to build four distinct capacities: spiritual, intellectual, physical, and emotional. These blinks will challenge you to build these capacities through thought exercises. You can do these exercises at any time, but they're designed to be built into your morning routine.\nNow, let's dig into the spiritual capacity. Successful individuals, organizations, collectives, and families all have one thing in common: they’ve identified their core values. What’s more, they live them out. That includes questioning themselves or others at times when those values are compromised.\nWhen building your spiritual capacity, focus on identifying your core values and your authentic purpose.\nNot sure where to start?\nTry the “one last talk” exercise. Imagine you’re given 20 minutes to give a talk on absolutely any topic. But there’s a catch: this will be the last talk you give before you die. What do you want to pass on to the world before you go?\nDon’t have time for a 20-minute talk? Then try the “legacy” exercise. All you need to do is answer one question. How would you want to be remembered in 100 years? Answering the question honestly requires you to examine your life in detail. Does the life you’re living connect with the legacy you want to achieve? And if it doesn’t, what changes do you need to make?\nWant to see all full key ideas from Friday Forward?\nShow Create account\nor\nSign up with Facebook\nSign up with Google\nOur Terms of Service apply.

        "text": "Key idea 1 of 8\nStoicism offers one of the best bets for happiness.\nNo one wants to live an unhappy life, right? In fact, people have been seeking the best ways to avoid unhappiness for a very long time. And in doing so, some of the brightest minds in history have spent lifetimes asking themselves what causes unhappiness and how we can avoid such things.\nWhile there have been advances in psychotherapy and neuroscience, the philosophy of Stoicism continues to be a popular resource for people who are seeking a reliable system of principles in their lives.\nThe key message here is: Stoicism offers one of the best bets for happiness.\nStoicism can be traced back to 300 BCE. However, one of the reasons it’s still relevant today is that many of the principles in Stoicism can still be found in modern psychiatric practices, like cognitive behavioral therapy.\nFor example, one of the core tenets of Stoicism is about learning how to focus on the things that are truly under your control. Often, our sources of unhappiness are related to things that are completely out of our control. We get hung up on the opinions of others, getting stuck in traffic, bad weather, illnesses, or fluctuations in the economy.\nWhat if we could learn to let go of our desires for goals that are unreliable? What if our happiness didn’t depend on things like money and the opinions of others? What if we could train ourselves so that our happiness was only dependent on things that are entirely in our control? This is one of the essential insights of Stoicism.\nIf this sounds appealing to you, then let’s take it a step further and quickly break down some of the fundamental Stoic principles.\nFor starters, there are three key areas to focus on: ethics, physics, and logic – all of which are interconnected. Ethics is about finding an ideal way to live. In order to do that, we should have an understanding of physics, which, in this case, refers to understanding how nature and humans work. And one of the main things to know about human beings is that we have the capacity for reason and logic, which will play a central role in solving problems and finding our ideal way of life.\nAll of this can be summed up by saying that Stoics believe the key to a peaceful existence is to live according to nature. So we shouldn’t underestimate the importance of understanding human nature – which includes recognizing the common habits and tendencies that can stand in the way of our wellbeing.\nWant to see all full key ideas from A Handbook for New Stoics?\nShow Create account\nor\nSign up with Facebook\nSign up with Google\nOur Terms of Service apply.

        "text": "Key idea 1 of 7\nAristotle had a turbulent life and only produced the work for which he is remembered during his final 12 years.\nIt is easier to list the subjects Aristotle didn’t write about than the subjects he did. What is “being?” Why do animals behave the way they do? What’s the best political system? How do you live well? These are just some of the questions Aristotle attempted to answer.\nEach of those attempts helped lay the foundations for a scholarly discipline. Without Aristotle, it is hard to imagine the development of metaphysics, zoology, political philosophy, or ethics.\nSure, this is an intimidating résumé, but late bloomers, take heart! All the work he is known for was produced late in life.\nBut before we jump into some of the intricacies of his work, let’s pose a different question. Just who was this extraordinarily prolific and influential person?\nThe key message in this blink is: Aristotle had a turbulent life and only produced the work for which he is remembered during his final 12 years.\nAristotle was born in 384 BCE in Stageira, a city-state in northern Greece. His childhood was disrupted in his thirteenth year when both his father and mother died. This was a time of great turbulence in the Greek-speaking world, and Aristotle was uprooted by the increasing military strife.\nAt the age of 17, he arrived in Athens, Ancient Greece’s center of learning and culture. There, he enrolled in Plato’s Academy, the first university in the Western world. Aristotle spent the next two decades learning from Plato, the greatest philosopher of his day.\nWhen Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and moved to a small kingdom in today’s Anatolia. He lived mainly in the cities of Atarneus and Assos. He married Pythias, the daughter of the kingdom’s ruler, Hermias. During this happy period, he spent a great deal of time studying the wildlife on the island of Lesbos.\nThen, in 343 BCE, everything changed. Philip II, the king of Macedonia, summoned Aristotle to teach his youngest son, Alexander, later known as Alexander the Great. Aristotle appears to have found court life, with all its intrigue and treachery, distasteful. After Philip was assassinated and Alexander became king, Aristotle returned to Athens.\nThere he spent the final 12 years of his life. It was an extraordinarily productive period. Every work for which he is remembered, not to mention the 130 texts that have been lost, was written during this golden period.\nThe philosopher Robert J. Anderson wrote, “There is no ancient thinker who can speak more directly to the concerns and anxieties of contemporary life” than Aristotle. Anderson was right, as we’ll find out in the following blinks.\nWant to see all full key ideas from Aristotle’s Way?\nShow Create account\nor\nSign up with Facebook\nSign up with Google\nOur Terms of Service apply.

        "text": "Key idea 1 of 8\nPower is the role we play in other people’s lives, and we all have it in one way or another.\nHigh status, impressive wealth, and the authority of a title. This is what we tend to think of when we hear the word “power.” We believe that the people who have these things are automatically powerful, but this isn’t quite true.\nPeople with status, money, or the right title can be powerful, but so can those with none of these things. For example, someone about to drive out of a full parking lot isn’t powerful on their own. But the minute someone else pulls up, eagerly waiting to take the parking spot, the first driver suddenly has power. If he wants to, he can delay the newcomer by being in no rush to leave.\nWhat this scene shows us is that power isn’t about what we have. It’s got more to do with social relationships, and how much we can control other people and their circumstances at any given time.\nThe key message here is: Power is the role we play in other people’s lives, and we all have it in one way or another.\nWhether relationships are professional, personal, or just with whoever happens to be nearby, they force us to depend on each other. This means that everyone has power, even if it looks or feels like they don’t.\nTake a parent-child relationship, for example. A parent can make decisions for the child and tell her what to do, making the parent powerful. But if the parent wants love and respect from their child – which most parents do – then the ability to give or withhold these means that the child has some power, too.\nWork settings provide another example. Bosses have power because they can determine who works on which projects and how much people get paid. But an employee who’s great at her job and highly sought after in the industry has the power to negotiate.\nNow, a boss can decide to use his power solely for his own benefit. For instance, he could hand over a heavy workload to a subordinate who can’t say no. But this isn’t what power is for.\nSocially and in the workplace, hierarchies and power dynamics help people work together for mutual benefit and to solve shared problems. This means that when thinking about how to use the power we have, we shouldn’t be asking “What’s in it for me?” We should consider how we can help other people instead.\nWant to see all full key ideas from Acting with Power?\nShow Create account\nor\nSign up with Facebook\nSign up with Google\nOur Terms of Service apply.

You’re enjoying the sun and the fresh sea breeze, patiently waiting for that perfect moment. But when you look back at the coastline, you realize you’re being carried away by a riptide. You paddle against the current, but it’s stronger than you and bears you out into the sea, far from where you want to be.\nFor many of us, that riptide is life.\nBy the time we hit forty or fifty, we find ourselves disoriented, exhausted, and adrift. We’re overworked, our health isn’t great, and our relationships have deteriorated. Life doesn’t look anything like what we previously imagined – and we have no idea how we’ve drifted so far off course.\nThe key message here is: To take control of your life, you need a Life Plan.\nYour life circumstances play a major role in how far you drift away from your ideal life. You might not always have control over these circumstances. But you can control how you respond to them.\nMaybe you already know this. You know that being overworked and living near a fast-food restaurant – your circumstances – doesn't mean you should regularly eat fast food. And yet, you consistently delay addressing your eating habits. You think, “I’ll stop eating fast food after this work deadline. I’m too stressed to change my diet now.” But once that project is done, you find another reason not to change your diet.\nOther times, you might incorrectly assume that certain circumstances are beyond your control. You tell yourself you can’t help eating takeout every night because your boss pressures you to stay late, so you don’t have time to shop for groceries and cook at home. These kinds of thought patterns trick you into thinking that you can’t take control of your life. But that’s simply not true! You can regain ownership of how you live. All you need is a Life Plan.\nCreating a Life Plan means taking responsibility for your life. It will help you proactively and intentionally make decisions that lead you in the direction you want to go. It will act as a reference point you can use to make sure you don’t get carried off by the current.

        "text": "Key idea 1 of 7\nPersonality testing isn’t about science – it’s about making money.\nHow many types of people are there in the world?\nWell, that depends on who you ask. One of the best-known personality tests, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, identifies 16 different kinds of personality. Then there’s the Revised NEO Personality Inventory, which claims that there are six different personality types. Other tests say three, or thirty-three.\nSo why do the people who design these tests come to such radically different conclusions? Here’s the short answer: personality testing is pseudoscience. Because there’s no way of proving or disproving any individual theory, test designers can come up with any answer they please. Usually, that’s little more than a way of marketing their product.\nThe key message in this blink is: Personality testing isn’t about science – it’s about making money.\nTake it from Merve Emre, the American author who literally wrote the book on personality testing. In her 2018 history of the industry, The Personality Brokers, Emre points out that the market for tests is worth around $2 billion. That’s a huge incentive for designers to pump out questionable tests and cash in on lucrative opportunities to “explain” the results they generate.\nThis isn’t a recent development, though. As Emre shows, the very origins of personality testing are steeped in pseudoscience. Myers-Briggs tests, for example, were developed in the early twentieth century. Neither Katherine Briggs nor her daughter, Isabel Myers, had a scientific background. In fact, they’d never so much as stepped foot in a lab.\nInstead, the test was based entirely on Briggs’s personal experiences. After noticing that she and her husband responded differently to similar situations and that one of their children was much more shy than the other, she began to speculate on personality differences.\nMyers and Briggs didn’t just identify different personalities, though – they also claimed that these were innate.

        "text": "Key idea 1 of 5\nFind role models to emulate and mentally engrave the desired skill in your mind.\nEveryone knows talent when they see it. The gravity-defying feats of dancers leave us in awe, and we can’t take our eyes off of athletes at the top of their game. Even in our daily lives, something done exceptionally well gives us pause, be it a mind-blowing restaurant meal or a superb work presentation.\nMany assume that talents like these are natural gifts and that such abilities are simply innate. But as it turns out, this isn’t quite true.\nTalent has more to do with our actions than what we inherit. With the right approach, we can all become as skilled as those we admire. The first step is to see ourselves in their shoes.\nThe key message here is: Find role models to emulate and mentally engrave the desired skill in your mind.\nWhen we encounter talented people with whom we identify, we start believing that we can be just as good. And this feeling is a strong motivation to develop a talent.\nMany talent incubators have benefited from this phenomenon. South Korea, for example, didn’t have a single player in the 1997 Ladies Professional Golf Association Tour. But when Se Ri Pak won the championship in 1998, she inspired hundreds of women in her country. Four years later, there were over 40 South Korean women on the tour. And what’s more, they won about a third of all the events.\nEven the smallest connection can light a spark. For instance, discovering that we share a birthday with a mathematician can increase the effort we put into math problems by about 60 percent.\nSo, if we want to become great at something, we should find role models among the best in that field. We will kickstart our motivation by flooding our brains with images of them, whether pictures and posters on the wall or online videos and imagining ourselves in the action.\nWhile we’re focusing on these images, we should also pay close attention to exactly how they do what they do. This is the next step in mastering a skill.\nBy observing a skill being performed over and over, we create vivid mental roadmaps to follow when we practice. With physical skills, this means noting every movement and imagining our own bodies repeating it. In more cerebral pursuits, it’s learning and emulating the thinking patterns involved. For instance, chess players watch and replay classic games to analyze and absorb strategy. Following their lead, we too should closely study the craft we’d like to master.\nWant to see all full key ideas from The Little Book of Talent?\nShow Create account\nor\nSign up with Facebook\nSign up with Google\nOur Terms of Service apply.

        "text": "Key idea 1 of 6\nWhen trying to achieve your goals, willpower is less important than your environment.\nPeople often say that willpower is like a muscle; the more you use it, the more you tire it out. And like any other muscle, you can strengthen your willpower over time – so exerting self-control today will make it a bit easier tomorrow.\nSo self-improvement is easy, right? To change our lives, we need to push ourselves a little bit harder every day – and before long, we’ll be ready to take on the world! Well, not exactly.\nThe problem with willpower is that it’s a pretty weak muscle. Our powers of self-control are almost always exhausted these days, but that’s not our fault.\nThe key message here is: When trying to achieve your goals, willpower is less important than your environment.\nLet’s consider the obesity epidemic. The facts are pretty stark: by 2025, it’s predicted that most people in the world will be overweight or obese. Is this down to a failure of willpower? Was it greater self-control that kept our ancestors skinny?\nOf course not. In the past, people didn’t need to rely on willpower to stay slim. What’s changed since then is our environment. These days, rather than working outdoors, most of us work sedentary jobs and sit at our desks all day. And the nourishment we rely on is often unhealthy food from a package.\nAs the author puts it, our environment has encouraged our weight gain. But thankfully, the power of your environment can also be a force for good. How so? Consider Darwin’s distinction between natural evolution and domesticated evolution.\nIn natural evolution, organisms adapt to whatever situation they find themselves in. So if it’s helpful to be smaller, a species may start to shrink. Essentially, they’re forced to adapt to their environment.\nContrast that with domesticated evolution, the evolution of animals and plants under human direction. Because we control these organisms’ environments, we can produce desirable traits that wouldn’t occur in the wild – like bigger fruits and fatter livestock.\nWhen it comes to people, many of us are like animals in the wild undergoing natural evolution. We’re often unable to change our environments, so we adapt to them instead – regardless of whether this benefits us in the long run. Others do the opposite. Similar to how we treat the animals we domesticate, they design their environments so that any adaptation is actually an improvement, bringing them one step closer to their goals.\nThe trick is to design an environment that leaves you no choice but to “adapt” into your ideal self. In the blinks that follow, we’ll look at some ways to do just this.\nWant to see all full key ideas from Willpower Doesn't Work?\nShow Create account\nor\nSign up with Facebook\nSign up with Google\nOur Terms of Service apply.

        "text": "Key idea 1 of 8\nThe path to well-being begins with self-compassion.\nImagine you’re climbing a steep mountain on a chilly October afternoon. The snow is turning to ice, it’s getting dark, and soon you won’t be able to see where you’re going. A wrong step could lead to injury – or worse. You’re getting exhausted, frozen, and terrified. What do you do?\nWell, the first step to ensuring survival is to accept the situation. Denying or fighting the danger could be deadly. But if you acknowledge the reality – and your feelings – you can free up the mental space to think about solutions.\nThat’s what saved the author when he found himself in this predicament. He made the decision to stay up on the mountain, wrapped in a blanket until first light, and lived to tell the tale. If he’d panicked and made a wrong move, the story might have ended up being very different.\nBut acceptance is not just something for emergencies. You can make it part of your entire life. It starts with compassion for yourself.\nThe key message here is: The path to well-being begins with self-compassion.\nCompassion is a combination of warm concern for feelings and a desire to relieve suffering. We can feel it both for others and for ourselves.\nMost of us have no problem feeling compassion for other people, but we struggle to feel it for ourselves. Have no fear, however – it’s something we can develop by following a few basic principles.\nTo start learning the art of self-compassion, you need to create repeat experiences of it. You can do this through a simple sequence of mental exercises. First, bring past experiences of compassion to the front of your mind. Second, focus on and feel them as fully as you can. For example, you can start by remembering a time when you were helping someone else – perhaps supporting a sick relative. Think about what it felt like and what kinds of feelings were going through your mind. That’s what compassion feels like. Now, apply this same attitude to yourself. Get a sense of what it feels like to be your own friend, and stay committed to it.\nSelf-compassion doesn’t just make you feel better in the moment; research shows that the more self-compassion you feel, the more resilient you become over time. That’s because it lowers your tendency to criticize yourself and, instead, helps you build up self-esteem. It can even help you become more ambitious and successful in both your personal and professional lives.\nWant to see all full key ideas from Resilient?\nShow Create account\nor\nSign up with Facebook\nSign up with Google\nOur Terms of Service apply.

        "text": "Key idea 1 of 8\nSetting boundaries is an act of kindness.\nWalls, fences, No Trespassing signs: when you think about it, your physical environment is delimited by all kinds of concrete boundaries. What’s more, those boundaries exist for good reason. That barbed wire fence around a nuclear power plant? It’s there for your own protection – it prevents you from inadvertently wandering into a hazardous zone.\nBoundaries are just as necessary for your emotional and spiritual protection. Unlike physical boundaries, however, emotional and spiritual boundaries aren’t laid out in a way that’s clear to everyone. That can make it difficult to establish your own boundaries and to discern those of others. Worse, enforcing your boundaries can make you feel mean. But it shouldn’t.\nThe key message here is: Setting boundaries is an act of kindness.\nWhen you set a boundary, you take ownership of your needs, wants, and feelings. Yet when we do this and prioritize ourselves, we often feel like we’re neglecting those of others.\nLet’s be clear: setting healthy boundaries doesn’t mean you have no stake in other people’s problems or spiritual concerns. It simply means that you’re not solely responsible for them. As the Bible’s book of Galatians teaches, you are responsible to others but for yourself.\nStill confused by this distinction? We can unpack it with the example of a hypothetical family. Let’s call them the O’Rileys.\nThe O’Riley’s are a loving family, but their son James has lost his way. He’s been expelled from school and developed a drug problem.\nThe O’Riley’s can take responsibility for their son’s issues by enrolling him in another school and paying the fines when he’s busted for drug possession. But will James solve his problem? Unlikely. Functionally, he doesn’t even have a problem – his parents have shouldered it for him.\nAlternatively, the O’Riley’s could own their responsibility to their son without taking responsibility for his problems. They can listen to him, support him, and take steps to facilitate his sobriety – all without stepping in to solve his problems for him. The O’Riley’s are taking care of themselves by setting those boundaries. But they’re also taking care of James. Setting boundaries is not just an act of kindness toward yourself. It’s an act of love toward everyone around you.\nWant to see all full key ideas from Boundaries?\nShow Create account\nor\nSign up with Facebook\nSign up with Google\nOur Terms of Service apply.

This might not surprise you: after all, to become so popular in the Christian community, it helps to see the best in the world. But that hasn’t always been the case. Early in his career as a pastor, the author encountered the first of our seven great challenges in life: cynicism. He had to work through it to become the jovial optimist he is today.\nWhen he first became a minister, Carey found work in a rural community in Ontario. He preached at three churches, the largest of which had an average attendance of 23 people. He wanted to grow his congregation, so he made sure the people who did show up felt special and well looked after.\nCarey cared about everyone who came to his church. But this caring broke his heart.\nThe key message here is: You don’t become cynical because you don’t care, but because you do.\nWhen Roger and Mary first showed up to Carey’s church, he could tell they needed special help. They were emotionally needy and destitute and sometimes couldn’t get to church because their car frequently broke down. Carey made sure they had gas money and drove across town whenever they needed spiritual or emotional guidance.\nOne day, Roger announced that they would stop coming to his church. The reason? Carey hadn’t done enough for them.\nRoger’s accusation shook Carey deeply. In the weeks that followed, he noticed that he had stopped caring and trusting people.\nHe knew he couldn’t continue like this. But what should he do?\nCarey remembered that God sent Jesus to counter inevitable human cynicism. Jesus confronted despair and made sure it wouldn’t win. Carey realized that as long as Jesus was in his life, he didn’t need to fear that his past would become his future.\nLetting Jesus into your life takes years. Luckily, we can take concrete actions right now to counter encroaching cynicism. First, schedule unstructured time for thinking and wondering. Staying open to possibilities that are new and different to scenarios you’ve already experienced can lead to unexpected joy. Second, ask open-ended questions, like “why?” and “why not?” and listen – really listen – to what people have to say. They might surprise you.\nBut the most important thing of all? Remaining curious. Curious people are never cynical, and cynical people are never curious.\nWant to see all full key ideas from Didn't See It Coming?\nShow Create account\nor\nSign up with Facebook\nSign up with Google\nOur Terms of Service apply.

It just amplifies what’s already there.\n4\nEmbracing change and fighting irrelevance helps deepen your impact.\n5\nPride is incredibly damaging but can be mitigated by cultivating humility.\n6\nRecovering from burnout requires patience and outside help.\n7\nMore stuff won’t cure a feeling of emptiness.

        "text": "Key idea 1 of 9\nThe ancient Eastern philosophy of Buddhism values ethics above all.\nIn March 2000, high in the Himalayas, Buddhism expert Owen Flanagan was lucky enough to find himself in the company of the Dalai Lama. Keen to seize the opportunity, Flanagan asked the leading Tibetan Buddhist a question about the ethics of killing someone.\nIf one could assassinate Hitler, or a similar evil figure, during that person’s rise to power, should one do it?\nThe Dalai Lama consulted his fellow spiritual leaders. It took them a few minutes to reach a conclusion. His response? It’s ethical to kill such a person. Then the Dalai Lama added a caution: “But don’t be angry.”\nThe key message here is: The ancient Eastern philosophy of Buddhism values ethics above all.\nEthics is a fundamental principle in Buddhism. One of a Buddhist’s main purposes in life is to minimize overall pain and suffering – and, ideally, to maximize happiness. That can involve deeds that seem bad, like killing Hitler. As long as you act in the right frame of mind, without becoming angry, you’d still be acting ethically. You’d still be acting out of compassion in your attempt to reduce the amount of suffering in the world as a whole.\nThe Buddha, otherwise known as Siddhartha Gautama, lived in the sixth century BCE. He developed Buddhism to stand in contrast to the Indian Brahmanic tradition that preceded Hinduism. The Brahmins believed that all living things were trapped in a cycle of birth and death. After death, a being’s permanent essence, or atman, transferred to another being. Escape from this cycle was only possible for the high-born Brahmins themselves.\nBuddha, however, rejected the notion of atman – he said that we did not possess that sort of permanent essence. Rather, he claimed that everything was impermanent. So, instead of striving for the release of one’s essence into the universe, Buddhism teaches that we should aim to obtain nirvana or salvation by leading good, selfless, ethical lives.\nOne thing to note is that Buddhism might help you reach some state of serenity – but that isn’t really the point. Buddhism isn’t about you. It’s about the good you can do for the world overall.\nWant to see all full key ideas from How to Live a Good Life?\nShow Create account\nor\nSign up with Facebook\nSign up with Google\nOur Terms of Service apply.

        "text": "Key idea 1 of 8\nThe need for safety is the basis of all other needs.\nEver been hangry? If you’re like most people, you probably have, even if you’re not familiar with the word. “Hanger” is hunger-induced anger, and though the word is obviously a humorous coinage, it points to a very real phenomenon.\nIt’s just one example of how, when basic needs like hunger aren’t met, negative emotions can overwhelm us, causing all other feelings and concerns to fade into the background.\nOur most basic need is safety. Safety means stability, a sense of certainty, and having trust in our environment. It’s the secure foundation that allows us to take risks and explore the world.\nThe key message here is: The need for safety is the basis of all other needs.\nBeyond physiological needs like hunger, our sense of safety comes down to how we relate to the people around us.\nOne of the ways we relate to others is called attachment, and it begins in childhood. Every human is born helpless and completely dependent on the people taking care of it. An infant’s sense of safety depends on its caregiver. If the caregiver is close and paying attention, the infant will feel safe and secure, and it will be willing to play and explore the world.\nBut if the caregiver leaves or stops paying attention, the infant will get anxious and start trying to get noticed again – by crying, for example.\nFrom these interactions in infancy, we develop our attachment style. As we grow older, our attachment style plays a key role in our relationships. If we were lucky enough to grow up in a warm, caring environment, we learn to be attached in a secure way. We feel confident that others will accept us. But if our caregivers weren’t reliable or sufficiently available, we become anxious in future relationships. We may even avoid close relationships altogether, which is called avoidant attachment.\nNo one’s attachment style is completely secure. There’s a broad spectrum between secure and avoidant, and most people have at least some levels of anxious or avoidant attachment – or both – especially in times of stress.\nStill, people who have a secure attachment style are better equipped to deal with life’s challenges.

        "text": "Key idea 1 of 6\nTackling problems on the surface never truly solves them; you need to go deep.\nSince she was a teenager, the author, Jordan Lee Dooley, had suffered from acne – terrible acne. As a thirteen-year-old, trying to impress a cute boy in class, she found it embarrassing. As an adult, doing a job that requires a certain amount of sitting in front of a camera, she found it a genuine problem.\nIt got to the point where she was having deep, painful breakouts, far below the skin. She resisted going to the doctor, mostly out of embarrassment. She struggled on, using makeup to cover up the imperfections in her appearance. But when she finally got to the doctor, he told her a truth that went further than her skincare issues.\nThe key message here is: Tackling problems on the surface never truly solves them; you need to go deep.\nJordan’s doctor told her that her attempts to cover up her acne problem with makeup were probably making it worse. While the cause of this problem was something deeper, like stress or diet, the makeup sure wasn’t helping.\nThere’s a lesson there for all of us. Have you ever felt the need to cover up your imperfections? Maybe you’ve felt that leaving your flaws on display would somehow be worse than the longer-term harm caused by covering them up.\nYou see, covering things up on the surface just keeps your insecurities under wraps, lingering for longer and becoming more and more damaging. Just like that acne.\nAll of us need to be brave enough to face up to the full truth of who we are. Because your purpose starts from being totally you. Not you with the bad parts covered up, but the real, raw you.\nSo here’s a challenge to help you build true confidence in yourself, from deep inside. For thirty days, make a commitment to stop criticizing yourself. Don’t call yourself fat. Don’t identify your flaws in each and every photo you take. Live by this rule of thumb: if you wouldn’t say something to your friend, don’t say it about yourself. If your best friend totally bombed while trying to make a joke over dinner, would you tell her she’s totally awkward and should just give up? No! So don’t say things like that to yourself either.\nStop obsessing about how you’re seen on the outside. Embrace your whole, true self. Because that’s where purpose starts.\nWant to see all full key ideas from Own Your Everyday?\nShow Create account\nor\nSign up with Facebook\nSign up with Google\nOur Terms of Service apply.

Maybe an unreasonable request from your boss helped you finally quit a job you hated? Or a chance meeting inspired you to move and start a new chapter in your life?\nWe all come to turning points like these. For Marianne, it was a painful Sunday morning after a night of drinking.\nThe key message here is: A nasty hangover kicked off Marianne’s quest for perfection.\nWhile she grappled with a pounding headache and a queasy stomach, anxiety and feelings of failure took center stage. Even though she felt fortunate to be making a good living as a freelance writer in London, the 36-year-old was unhappy.\nMarianne’s friends and peers seemed to be moving forward in life. They were getting married, starting families, and buying houses. But without a partner, a house to her name, or a plan for the future, Marianne felt stuck in a rut.\nAnd it wasn’t the first time.\nMore than 10 years before, Marianne had been miserable in her job. So she’d turned to a self-help book for guidance. The book surprised her. It gave her the confidence to leave her job and jumpstart her journalism career. After that, Marianne was hooked on self-help. She read any and every book that promised more money, the love of her life, and career success.\nExcept none of those things materialized. Despite all the self-help she devoured, Marianne’s finances never improved. Her dream man was nowhere to be seen. Sure, she had a successful career, but this was all down to a work ethic driven by fear.\nThen, on that hungover Sunday, Marianne had not one, but two, lightbulb moments.\nFirst, she realized that all the time she’d been reading self-help books, she’d never acted on the advice they gave her. This, she thought, was why her life hadn’t changed. Then the second lightbulb went on: if she started doing self-help instead of simply reading it, then she wouldn’t be unhappy. Far from it – she’d be perfect!\nAnd so Marianne decided to read one self-help book a month for a year and implement everything she learned.\nWant to see all full key ideas from Help Me!?\nShow Create account\nor\nSign up with Facebook\nSign up with Google\nOur Terms of Service apply.

        "text": "Key idea 1 of 7\nThe world is full of arbitrary rules that you don’t need to follow.\nLife is full of rules. With the exception of laws and formal codes of conduct, most of these are unwritten and enforced by social pressure. Some make a lot of sense. “Don’t tag your friends in unflattering photos” and “Don’t answer the door nude” are pretty good rules, for example.\nOthers, however, don’t make a lot of sense. And because the world is full of sticklers hellbent on enforcing these arbitrary rules, there are always going to be folks telling you when you should go to college or have kids, or what you should wear to a party. Breaking these rules might not land you in prison, but it may lead to social ostracism.\nBut here’s the thing: deep down, no one knows more about who you are and what makes you happy than you do. Living by other people’s rules risks leading you away from this intuitive understanding of what you need to do. Instead of living in ways that fulfill you, you may get pressured into Lowest Common Denominator Living. You’ll stifle traits and tics that don’t fit other people’s definition of normality, and consequently end up miserable.\nIn these blinks, we’ll help you break out of this trap. The name of the game is to learn to see social expectations for what they are and take some of the pressure off yourself by refusing to follow senseless rules.\nThe best place to start doing this is to embrace a model called Mental Redecorating, an approach to reappraising your supposed “flaws.”\nThis is about recoding qualities that society regards as negative. “Nerdy,” for instance, is often used to put people down. Mental redecorating, by contrast, would redescribe this character trait in positive terms like “smart” or “knowledgable.” The same goes for a word like “weird,” which is just another way of saying “unique.”\nThe point to bear in mind here is that there’s nothing wrong with who you are – the social rules that make you think you’re the problem are to blame. With that in mind, let’s take a look at how you can start breaking away from social expectations.\nWant to see all full key ideas from You Do You?\nShow Create account\nor\nSign up with Facebook\nSign up with Google\nOur Terms of Service apply.

        "text": "Key idea 1 of 7\nA poor self-image leads to self-defeating behavior.\nSo you’ve decided it’s time to change your ways and start aiming for the top. Where do you begin?\nThe first step on the ladder to success is to evaluate your self-image – that is, how you view yourself. Self-image is a crucial building block for success because it determines how you perform.\nFor many people, self-image issues can be traced back to childhood. Let’s say your son accidentally drops a plate; without thinking, you tell him he’s the clumsiest boy you’ve ever seen. You might not intend for your comment to be destructive, but for many children, offhand remarks like this can lead to an inferiority complex. When parents, teachers, or friends imply that a child is inept, that child might come to believe that he doesn’t deserve good things in life, such as love or success.\nOn the other hand, imagine how you’d feel if you received a phone call from someone who simply wanted to tell you how great you are. Whether you’re a doctor, a student, or an athlete, this kind of boost to your confidence would likely make you perform better. In fact, the link between a positive self-image and high performance has a proven track record – in elite sports, athletes often visualize themselves succeeding in order to achieve real-life success. Top golfers, for example, “see” themselves sinking their ball into the cup before they even tee up.\nBut developing a positive self-image can be hard. This is especially true for children, who not only face criticism from parents and teachers but also feel the weight of society’s emphasis on appearance. Multiple surveys have found that over 95 percent of young Americans would opt to change some aspect of their physical appearance. Later in life, this dissatisfaction often leads to an unhealthy obsession with material possessions and body image.\nHaving a negative view of yourself also informs your behavior in your professional life.\nImagine a salesman with a negative self-image. He lives in constant fear of rejection, and this mindset causes him to be a people pleaser. This doesn’t just undermine his ability to make sales – his need to be accepted by his teammates also stops him from adopting the leadership skills that would enable him to rise into management.\nUnless he finds a way to alter his self-image, the salesman will never be able to envision success for himself on either a personal or professional level.\nWant to see all full key ideas from See You at the Top?\nShow Create account\nor\nSign up with Facebook\nSign up with Google\nOur Terms of Service apply.

        "text": "Key idea 1 of 8\nOur fast-paced world and hunger for success are increasing our stress levels.\nWe’ve all heard the warnings. Our busy lives are sending us into a spiral of stress. Health experts around the world are telling us to slow down, take time off, and implement more work-life balance. Many of us have taken up yoga and meditation to calm our nerves, or are simply popping pills to help us get some sleep.\nAll of this raises the question, why are we so stressed?\nHere’s the key message: Our fast-paced world and hunger for success are increasing our stress levels.\nAccording to author Richard Sutton, our physical and mental well-being depends on our ability to establish balance in our lives. If we’re balanced, we’re able to move easily between states of arousal and regeneration – or, activity and rest.\nThe problem is, modern society makes it impossible for us to maintain our balance for several reasons.\nFor one thing, being constantly connected via technology makes it harder for us to defend our free time. We’re available 24 hours a day to respond to work calls or emails, or reply to friends or family that need our support. As a result, our schedules are brimming with things to do and people to attend to – while time for ourselves is often left off the list.\nAnother reason is this: admiration of success and an intolerance of failure is fast becoming the norm in our society.\nWhether we realize it or not, all of us are pushing ourselves to be bigger and better than ever before. At the same time, our desire to compete, and ultimately succeed, is steadily increasing. Now, longer working hours, extended work weeks, and less annual leave are commonplace in working environments. Is it any wonder that our stress levels are skyrocketing?\nThe bad news is that it’s only getting worse. According to a study completed by researchers at the Yale University School of Medicine and the University of California, Los Angeles, the average person in developed society experiences between four and five episodes of stress every week.\nFor many of us, life often feels like walking a tightrope: we try to move forward steadily, but personal and professional pressures always threaten to push us off balance. That’s why learning to manage stress – and even to harness it for our benefit – is crucial. We’ll take a look at this in the following blinks.\nWant to see all full key ideas from The Stress Code?\nShow Create account\nor\nSign up with Facebook\nSign up with Google\nOur Terms of Service apply.

        "text": "Key idea 1 of 8\nConfronted by a world of complexity, we desire simplicity most of all.\nLet’s imagine that you need to email a colleague in your office. You switch on your computer. But before it can load, there are updates. You’re prompted to restart the machine. So you do, and after five long minutes, the system has finally updated. But wait – now, the computer needs to conduct a virus scan as the wi-fi seems to shut down.\nAll of this just to speak to someone a few desks away!\nThe key message here is: Confronted by a world of complexity, we desire simplicity most of all.\nThough our sophisticated technology has simplified many things like data storage and number-crunching, it has also come with a bundle of complexity. It drives us to distraction and goes against what we want most – simplicity.\nOne person who understood this was Steve Jobs. Simplicity is at the heart of Apple’s products, from their smooth, sleek esthetic to their easy-to-use functionality. Although we all seek the convenience that complex technology brings, we want it to function as simply as possible. That’s the chief reason behind Apple’s success.\nIn fact, if you take a closer look at the most successful companies in the world, one thing unites them. From Amazon to Johnson & Johnson, they make things straightforward for the customer. Even though there’s a great deal of complexity to what they do internally, the customer experience is one of simplicity.\nOur desire for simplicity can be seen in modern election results, too. Many people across the world have disengaged with the complexity and nuance of modern politics. So, when an election comes around, they tend to vote for the simplest offer.\nTake the United Kingdom’s 2016 Brexit referendum. The “Leave” campaign won – in part – because it had the most straightforward message: “Take Back Control.” The “Remain” side, with their complex and nuanced case for internationalism, found themselves unable to counter such directness. The same is true of Trump’s 2016 victory. His campaign can easily be encapsulated in the simple, nationalistic slogan: “Make America Great Again.” Whether you agree or disagree with the politics of Brexit or Trump, voters largely craved simplicity in a complicated world.\nThat’s not to say complexity isn’t necessary and preferable sometimes. But in the twenty-first century, we’ve needlessly complicated things that should be very simple – like our communication with voters and our work schedules. Let’s see what we can do to simplify things in the following blinks.\nWant to see all full key ideas from The Simplicity Principle?\nShow Create account\nor\nSign up with Facebook\nSign up with Google\nOur Terms of Service apply.

        "text": "Key idea 1 of 8\nBy reframing our fear, we can use it to improve our performance.\nThink back to the last time you took an important exam. How did you feel just before sitting down? Were you pumped and ready to ace every question? Or were you sick to the stomach, worried that you’d forgotten to study something crucial and imagining your inevitable failure?\nWe all respond differently to anticipated fears. While some of us welcome the rush of adrenaline that a risky situation brings, many – if not most – of us panic. This panic triggers all kinds of physical responses, from dizziness to desperately needing the restroom.\nIf this sounds all too familiar, don’t worry. By learning how to reinterpret your physical responses to challenges, you can transform yourself from a fretter to a fighter.\nThe key message here is: By reframing our fear, we can use it to improve our performance.\nThose fiery exam takers, convinced of their success, are in what’s called a challenge state. Much like the stress-heads, their body floods with adrenaline when confronted by stress. But instead of interpreting their sweaty palms and increased heart rate as signs that they’re about to fail, they see them as their body preparing for a battle they’ll win. As they imagine their success, the reward center in their brain activates, which reduces fear. This in turn increases oxygen levels in their blood, so that they can make fast, reliable decisions.\nThe good news is, we can all get into a challenge state and respond positively to stress. To do so, take time before your next big event to visualize how brilliantly you’ll perform. For example, if you have a job interview, imagine yourself dressed to impress. See yourself confidently greeting your interviewer, and picture yourself calmly and audibly answering every question. Repeat this practice as much as possible before your appointment. It will help you feel in control and keep your fear at bay.\nPay attention to your self-talk too. Substitute every negative thought for a positive one. Instead of telling yourself that you’re doomed to fail, root for yourself!

You’re chatting to someone you’ve just met, and they ask you the inevitable question: What do you do for a living?\nYou tell them you’re head of sales for The Walt Disney Company’s movie studio. That’s right. The Disney. You’re the one putting movies like Frozen, Inside Out, and all things Marvel in cinemas around the world. And you’re good at it. Very good, according to your salary.\nNaturally, your new acquaintance is impressed. Their face lights up. You heave an internal sigh. If only your job lit you up in the same way.\nThe key message here is: Equating our personal value with our profession undermines our self-worth.\nOnce upon a time, author Dave Hollis was that disgruntled sales executive at Disney. With an endless supply of blockbuster movies and a fabulous team working with him every day, he was exceeding sales targets and making more money than ever before. But Dave was deeply unhappy. Since he could practically do his job with his eyes closed, he felt underchallenged and unfulfilled.\nDespite feeling this way, Dave was hesitant to make any bold changes. People were in awe of his job title; because of this, he’d allowed his work to become his identity. He’d always prided himself on his successful and evolving career. Leaving it behind felt like letting go of the very thing that made people see him as valuable. But Dave longed to free himself from what other people thought about him. He had to make a change.\nAnd so he took a leap.\nHe resigned from Disney and took up the role of CEO at his wife’s business, The Hollis Company. It was a challenge shifting from a mass media company to a small start-up, and Dave had to relearn everything he thought he knew about business. But this was just the stimulation he needed. And it taught him something important about himself: His value as a person didn’t come from the size of his paycheck or his employer’s prestige. It came from being a loving, respectful individual who cared about the world around him. And he could be that person, even without a fancy title on his business card.\nWant more?\nRead or listen to the key ideas\nfrom 7,000+ titles\nShow Create account\nor\nSign up with Facebook\nSign up with Google\nOur Terms of Service apply.

        "text": "Key idea 1 of 10\nBefore you begin your journey, you need to know who you are and what you want.\nYou can’t wander through the jungle without a map and expect to reach your destination. In the same way, you can’t really grow unless you understand where you want to go. But for a lot of people, this is easier said than done; knowing exactly where you want to go is not always obvious.\nSo how can you find out? The best way is to really get to know yourself and what you want. That can be challenging to accomplish, of course. But if you ask yourself these key questions you’ll be on the right track.\nFirst of all, ask yourself if you’re happy with what you’re doing right now. Does your work make you feel fulfilled and passionate? Do you start the day with a spring in your step? Or are you lethargic, tired, and irritable? If it’s the latter, you’re clearly not doing what fulfills you.\nSo what will fulfill you? The answer to that question is as unique as your fingerprints; it’s specific to your personality, your values, and your dreams. In order to identify it, you need to observe yourself closely. Notice when something makes you “light up,” moves you, or gets you especially excited. Think about times in your life that you’ve felt useful and valued by the people around you.\nOnce you’ve discovered what you want to do, you should stop for a quick reality check. Is your dream doable? Yes, dreams should take you beyond your current reality – that’s why they’re called dreams. But if your dream is to be a professional basketball player, and you hate exercising and have terrible coordination, then your dream is actually something else: a fantasy. An achievable dream should line up with your talents and capabilities. When you’ve established that your dream is potentially attainable, you should ask yourself the next probing question: Why do you want to do it?\nThis is a really important one. You need to sniff out any hidden agendas you may have. For example, if you say you want to do a PhD because you’re passionate about learning, but in fact you just want to impress people, you’ll run into trouble.\nNot that there’s anything wrong with wanting to impress people! But it’s probably not a strong enough motivation to get you through a grueling PhD program. More importantly, you’d essentially be doing it for someone else, which wouldn’t make you happy in the long run. What you need to find is a passion that will make you happy just by pursuing it.\nWant more?\nRead or listen to the key ideas\nfrom 7,000+ titles\nShow Create account\nor\nSign up with Facebook\nOur Terms of Service apply.

        "text": "Key idea 1 of 9\nA map is a simplified representation of a complicated reality.\nMental models are tools that help us navigate reality. The most obvious example is a map. As familiar as it might seem, this classic navigational aid illustrates some of the basic features, benefits, and limits of mental models in general. So it’s a good place to start.\nThe purpose of a map is to represent the world in a way that’s useful to us. To accomplish this purpose, a map needs to focus on certain aspects of reality while ignoring everything else. For instance, if you’re trying to navigate the London Underground, all you need is a map that shows the overall layout of the subway’s rails and stations – the information that will help you get to your destination. A simple array of lines and circles will do the trick.\nThe key message here is: A map is a simplified representation of a complicated reality.\nOf course, the resulting map – that network of lines and circles – leaves out a lot of details. But that’s unavoidable. To see why, imagine trying to create a map that shows every little detail of the London Underground, right down to the nuts and bolts of the railroad tracks. Such a map would be completely impractical – way too big to fit inside your pocket, and way too complicated to help you get from point A to point B!\nSo we don’t want a map to include every aspect of the reality it represents. But we also don’t want to forget that it leaves out a lot of details. Sure, many of them are irrelevant to us, like the nuts and bolts of the railroad tracks. But some of them are important to keep in mind. If you’ve ever been so busy looking down at your smartphone map that you walked straight into a lamppost, then you know this firsthand. Or if your GPS device has ever led you to a road that’s closed, then you know the importance of having a map that’s fully up-to-date.\nThese lessons apply not just to literal maps, but to more metaphorical maps as well. Financial statements, policy papers, parenting manuals, even news articles – they all offer map-like simplifications of reality. A company’s financial statement, for instance, condenses thousands of transactions into a single, easily digestible document.\nThese simplifications are meant to guide us through the complicated world around us. But if we forget about what they’re leaving out of the picture, and if we fail to update them as the world changes, they can also lead us astray and get us into trouble.\nWant to see all full key ideas from The Great Mental Models?\nShow Create account\nor\nSign up with Facebook\nOur Terms of Service apply.

        "text": "Key idea 1 of 9\nNegative experiences are more powerful than positive ones.\nLet’s say you’re in a relationship. Like most relationships, it’s not perfect. Sometimes, your partner is wonderful. They’re smart, kind, and funny. But, every so often, they’re the opposite. They’re mean, vindictive, and distant. Do you stick around?\nEarly in his career, Roy Baumeister found himself facing this very question. To make a decision, he kept track of the days. He recorded which were good, which were bad, and which were neutral. After a few months, the pattern was clear: the good days outnumbered the bad 2 to 1.\nWith this data, he knew what to do; he left.\nThe key message here is: Negative experiences are more powerful than positive ones.\nIf you’re like most people, you probably agree with Baumeister’s decision to break off the tumultuous and uneven romance. A relationship that is only pleasant two-thirds of the time doesn’t seem like an appealing prospect. For most people, “2 to 1” is not an acceptable positivity ratio.\nThis is a term used by social psychologists to describe the ratio between any given set of good and bad events. Countless studies have shown that, in many scenarios, an overall positive outcome requires a high positivity ratio. That is, positive events need to greatly outnumber negative ones.\nA classic study conducted by psychologist John Gottman demonstrates how this works. He asked married couples to record their daily interactions as either positive or negative. He found that couples with an even number of good and bad interactions usually broke up. He also found that the happiest couples had at least five positive interactions for every negative one.\nThis 5-to-1 ratio is sometimes known as the Gottman Ratio. It works as a pretty good rule of thumb for measuring happiness in a relationship but can also work in other contexts.\nTo measure your own personal growth, Baumeister recommends aiming for at least four positives for every one negative. For instance, let’s say you’re trying to maintain a new habit like a daily yoga practice or skipping dessert after dinner. Don’t be too upset if you slip up one day. Instead, just try to hit your mark the next four days.\nThis 4-to-1 approach gives you a more accurate perspective on your overall success. It also keeps you from letting one setback set the tone of your entire week. In the next blink, we’ll look at some ways to maintain a high positivity ratio.\nWant to see all full key ideas from The Power of Bad?\nShow Create account\nor\nSign up with Facebook\nOur Terms of Service apply.
